scp rider/lib/functions/functions.dart root@VPS:/var/www/tagxi/.../flutter_user/flutter_user/lib/functions/
scp driver/lib/utils/safe.dart root@VPS:/var/www/tagxi/.../flutter_driver/flutter_driver/lib/utils/
scp driver/lib/functions/functions.dart root@VPS:/var/www/tagxi/.../flutter_driver/flutter_driver/lib/functions/
```

### 3?? Build APKs
```bash
# On VPS
cd /var/www/tagxi/.../flutter_user/flutter_user
flutter clean && flutter pub get && flutter build apk --debug

cd /var/www/tagxi/.../flutter_driver/flutter_driver
flutter clean && flutter pub get && flutter build apk --debug

## ?? If Issues Persist

1. **Admin maps still broken:**
   - Wait 5 minutes for GCP changes to propagate
   - Clear browser cache
   - Verify API key restrictions in GCP Console

2. **Rider/Driver still crashes:**
   - Get error logs: `adb logcat | grep flutter`
   - Look for field names causing null errors
   - Add safe parsing for those fields using the `safe.dart` helpers

3. **Build fails:**
   - Check Flutter version: `flutter --version`
   - Clean completely: `flutter clean && rm -rf .dart_tool`
   - Retry: `flutter pub get && flutter build apk --debug`

---

## ?? What's Next

After successful deployment:

1. **Monitor app performance**
   - Watch for crash reports
   - Check API usage in GCP Console
   - Monitor Laravel logs

2. **Optional improvements**
   - Add more null-safety checks for other fields
   - Implement release builds with signing
   - Set up automated testing

3. **Production release**
   - Test thoroughly with real users
   - Build release APKs: `flutter build apk --release`
   - Upload to Google Play Store
